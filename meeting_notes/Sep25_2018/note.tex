\section{Setup} \label{sec:setup}

Consider a model $Z(\vx, t, \lambda)$ that produces discretized output for a given QoI (in this case, GPP only is considered) $Z$
over a period of time $t\in \Omega_t$ and over space $\vx=(x,y)\in \Omega_x$
(typically a rectangular region)\footnote{where $x$ is longitude, $y$ is
latitude.}, for a given parameter vector $\lambda\in \RR^d$.

\bi
\item Raw data: ensemble of daily simulations is available, i.e. $\{Z(\vx_i, t_j, \lambda_n)\}$
for $i=1,\dots, I$, $j=1,\dots, J$ and $n=1, \dots, N$, where $I=61\times 41$,
$J=N_y\times 365$ and $N=2000$. Number of years is set to $N_y=24$.
\item Monthly averages are taken first, so, with some abuse of notation,
let us set $J=N_y \times 12$.
\item The actual QoI to be analyzed is the month-by-month average over all years, i.e., for $j=1,\dots, 12$
\be
\bar{Z_j}(\vx,\lambda)=\frac{1}{N_y}\sum_{k=0}^{N_y-1} Z(\vx,t_{j+12k}, \lambda)
\ee
\item We have several sites available, and for the $S=8$ sites that are in the region $\Omega_x$, we identify the closest $\vx_i$, see Figure~\ref{fig:map}. Therefore, the QoIs for which we build surrogates are
\be
Q_{ij}(\lambda)=\bar{Z_j}(\vx_i,\lambda), \textrm{  for } i=1,\dots, S \textrm{ and  } j=1, \dots, 12
\ee

\section{Surrogates}

A total of $12S=96$ surrogates are build, using BCS and second order Legendre-basis. A subset of inputs lead to $0$ GPP - we ignored those inputs (in fact we ignored all below $0.02$) for surrogate construction. The surrogates have shown relative errors between $5\%-15\%$, as demonstrated in two example plots in Figure~\ref{fig:surr}.

\end{figure}

The sensitivities for the eight sites over 12 months are shown in Figure~\ref{fig:sens} (minus the winter months with zero GPP for all ensemble members.).
