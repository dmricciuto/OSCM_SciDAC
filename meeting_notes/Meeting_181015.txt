2.	Relevant publications

D. Ricciuto, K. Sargsyan, P. Thornton (2017).   The impact of parametric uncertainties in the E3SM land model.   JAMES, accepted.

D. Lu, D. Ricciuto, A. Walker, C. Safta, W. Munger (2017).  Bayesian calibration of terrestrial ecosystem models:  A study of advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods.   Biogeosciences, accepted.

3.	E3SM update
-	“Dedicated” project staff have been chosen for next phase– mostly working on core activities.   Regular staff – still unclear.
-	Proposal white paper due Jan 16th (full proposal due in spring)
-	Next generation “NGD” projects to be determined next week
o	Epics (major subtasks) and project leads
o	Land UQ role/tasks should be more clear next week.
o	Atmosphere NGDs – SCAM and/or UQ?
More recent documentation from Peter B. and Peter C.
-	Land Model v1 is finalized (but there are 2 versions – some clarity on this next week)
-	Draft collaboration agreement, I am behind but will send around for comment next week.

4.	 Progress 

      Tasks 1-2
       See Khachik and Cosmin’s AGU presentations showing advances in embedded error representation and machine learning techniques
       Discussion at AGU – given that it may be several months before we have a functional SCAM-ELM ensemble framework, we agreed that a simple, well-tested land model like DALEC (Safta et al., 2015, Lu et al., 2017) would be useful.   But, we might need to add energy/hydrology for greater relevance.
Initial commit of python-based DALEC and new project repo:  https://github.com/dmricciuto/OSCM_SciDAC (please send your github ID)
 - include notes on model structure

Task 4:  ORNL-MIT Subcontract being finalized.  We agreed that the simple modeling framework would also be useful to test the network optimization concept.  We will be creating a regional gridded version of DALEC that uses reanalysis forcing.
Task 5:  Dan Lu submitted MLMC paper (see above).  We will discuss how to use gridded DALEC in an MLMC framework.

Task 6:  Meeting on 12/19 with Dan Lu, Kate Evans, Dan Ricciuto and Joe Kennedy to discuss setup of SCAM and workflow for ensemble simulations.  CIME can handle ensembles (multi-instance capability).  E3SM has a working version of SCAM but for the Eulerian dynamical Core.
