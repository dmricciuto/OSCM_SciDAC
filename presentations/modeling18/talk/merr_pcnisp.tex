\item Zero-mean PC form $\delta_\alpha=\sum_{k=1}^{K} \alpha_k \Psi_k(\xi)$
\item Functional representation of a large class of random variables
\item The PC \emph{germ} $\xi$ is a standard random variable
\bi
\item e.g. Uniform$(-1,1)$ or Normal$(0,1)$
\ei
\item The PC bases (e.g. Legendre or Hermite polynomials) are orthogonal w.r.t. PDF of $\xi$
\[
\int \Psi_m(\xi)\Psi_k(\xi)\pi_\xi(\xi)d\xi=0 \quad\textrm{ for } m\neq k.
\]
\item PC representation allows efficient
\bi
\item Sampling
\item Moment estimation
\item Variance-based decomposition
\item Uncertainty propagation (via NISP)
