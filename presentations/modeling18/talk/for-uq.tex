\item Uncertain inputs/outputs as random variables

\hspace*{4cm}\mybox{$y=f(\lambda)$}

\item Default way - sampling:
\bi
 \setlength\itemsep{0.1cm}
\item Random sampling, MC/QMC
\item Generate random samples $\{\lambda_i\}_{i=1}^N$ from the PDF of $\lambda$, $p(\lambda)$
\item Evaluate the model $y_i=f(\lambda_i)$, construct $p(y)$ or gather statistics
\item Slow convergence of MC/QMC $\Rightarrow$ infeasibly large $N$ required
\ei

\item Build a cheap surrogate for $f(\lambda)$, then use MC

\bi
 \setlength\itemsep{0.1cm}
\item Collocation -- interpolants
\item Regression -- fitting
\ei
\item \textbf{Polynomial Chaos (PC)} is a convenient machinery
