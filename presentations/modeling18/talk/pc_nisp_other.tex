\bi
\item Interpolation: Fit interpolant to samples
\bi\item Oscillation concern in multi-D\ei
\medskip
\item Regression: Estimate best-fit response surface 
\bi
\item Least-squares 
\bi\item Sparsity via $\ell_1$ constraints; compressive sensing\ei
\item Bayesian inference 
\bi\item Sparsity via Laplace priors; Bayesian compressive sensing\ei
\item Useful when quadrature methods are infeasible, e.g.:
\bdi
\item Samples given \emph{a priori}
\item Can't choose sample locations 
\item Can't take enough samples
\item Forward model is noisy
